// Time Lock and Governor Contract is kind of same but Time Lock is OWNER

// we want to wait for a new vote to be "executed"
// bcz lets say there is new proposol that says "every one has to pay 5 governance token"
// so these governanceContract give time to "get out" is user dont like governance update
// so once the proposal passes it will wait for some time
