/**
         * Events
         * When ever update any dynamic entities like array / mapping we should emmit "events"
         * Events alloes you to "print" stuff to this log (type of special data structure)
         * Events and Logs live in special data structure that is not accessible by Smart Contracts
         * so it is cheaper
         * so we can print some stuff which are important to us w/o having to store in storage
         * variable which take much more gas
         * each one of the events are tied to smart contract or account address that emitted that
         * events in these transactions, listening for these events is helpful
         * events have two keyword 1.Indexed parameters 2.NonIndexed parameters
         * you can have Upto "3" Indexed Parameters , also known as "Topics"
         * so when we see Tpoic then it will be Indexed parameters
         * Indexed parameters are searchable
         * NonIndexed parameters are harder to search as they are abi encoded so you need abi to decode * them
         * "emit" the event, this will store data into logging Data Structure
         * NonIndexed parameters will be data in etherScan, cost less gas
         * we can see after we verify in etherScan
         * Name events with the function name reversed  
         *   */
